# Heap
This project demonstrates the implementation of a binary heap using array representation. Also, heap operations are performed on the binary heap in this project. In order to run this program, please have all the source codes for "HeapDriver.java", "MaxHeap.java", and "MaxHeapInterface.java" in the source code folder. Then, please have "data_random.txt" and "data_sorted.txt" one directory before the source code folder in order to execute the driver program. The main method in "HeapDriver.java" will read sequences of integers from "data_sorted.txt" and "data_random.txt" and output the results of performing heap operations into "outputFile.txt" file.
